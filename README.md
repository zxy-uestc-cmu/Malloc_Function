# Malloc_Function

I only upload the core 'malloc.c' file, and other dependent and testing files are a little secret and hidden.

Implemented the malloc function, and explored different strategies including explicit list, segregated free list, footer-free, FIFO/LIFO to balance space and time efficiency. It achieved throughput 5% greater than benchmark (21,564K options/sec), and memory utilization 3% greater than benchmark (74.0%).
